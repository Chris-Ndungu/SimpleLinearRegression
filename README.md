# Simple Linear Regression
__Simple linear regression__ is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two continuous variables: one independent variable (predictor) and one dependent variable. It is a basic and widely used approach for understanding and predicting how changes in the independent variable relate to changes in the dependent variable.

The simple linear regression model is represented by the equation:

__Y = β₀ + β₁X + ε__

Where:  
    __Y__ is the dependent variable (the variable you want to predict or explain).  
    __X__ is the independent variable (the predictor or feature).   
     __β₀__ is the intercept, representing the value of Y when X is 0.   
    __β₁__ is the slope or coefficient, representing the change in Y for a one-unit change in X.    
    __ε__ represents the error term, accounting for the variability in Y that is not explained by the linear relationship with X.

The goal of simple linear regression is to estimate the values of __β₀__ and __β₁__ that best fit the data. These estimates are typically obtained using the method of least squares, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences (residuals) between the observed Y-values and the values predicted by the model.
